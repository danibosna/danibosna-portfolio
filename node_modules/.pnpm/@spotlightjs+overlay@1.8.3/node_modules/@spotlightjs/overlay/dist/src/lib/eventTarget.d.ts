/**
 * Returns the global singleton event target for spotlight.
 *
 * This is used to communicate between spotlight and the outside world.
 * To avoid instances where multiple versions of spotlight code are loaded,
 * we put the target onto the global object.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/issues/68
 *
 * In case of window being undefined (e.g. in SSR), we return a fallback event target.
 * which is local to one spotlight code instance.
